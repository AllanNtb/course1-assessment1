Case study
City Gym has been in business for two years and is seeing a steady increase in the number of
members. It offers:
• exercise equipment
• added services like personalised training, 24/7 gym access, diet advice, and online
fitness videos.
The owners of City Gym have asked you to develop some programs that will help improve
their administration processes.
Digitising membership plans and costs
Currently, the administration team uses paper-based documentation, such as forms and
files. They would like to gradually move to a digital format, starting with automating how
membership plans and costs are calculated.
Right now, the staff member must manually calculate the costs for the membership.
Occasionally, this leads to a mistake, which is difficult to correct once the client is registered.
The gym owners saw an opportunity to implement a software solution to help staff figure
out the cost of the membership for potential new clients.
While the gym has a computer capable of running console applications, no database has
been set up yet. This programme would allow staff and clients to check the price for the
various plans and options available for gym membership. However, since there is no
database available, the program will only be informational and perform a few simple
functions.
Gym Challenge
Finally, the City Gym team would like to host a gym challenge for current members, with
clients competing to achieve the overall fastest time in four cardio exercises. The members
will have to enter their times for the four exercises into a computer program. The program
then ranks them based on their total time.
The gym owners want this to be a fun and encouraging opportunity for their clients as they
work on increasing their own fitness levels.
